# Online Judge Solutions

Welcome to the Online Judge Solutions repository! My name is Dabananda Mitra, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at the Institute of Science Trade & Technology (ISTT), 2019-2020 session. My graduation will complete in the middle of 2025.

This repository contains my daily solutions to programming problems from various online judges, where I primarily use C++.

The platforms where I solve problems include:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/dabananda)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/dabananda/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/dabananda)
- [Beecrowd](https://judge.beecrowd.com/en/profile/467832)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/dabananda)
- [CodingNinjas](https://www.naukri.com/code360/profile/48a35475-0af2-4d4e-8f26-2d793b64843a)
- [Vjudge](https://vjudge.net/user/dabanandamitra)
- [UVa](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/1167157)

These solutions cover a variety of problem types, including data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more. My goal is to become a software engineer, and solving problems regularly helps me to improve my skills and prepare for a career at a big tech company like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, or others.
